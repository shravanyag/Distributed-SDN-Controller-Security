# Distributed-SDN-Controller-Security

The aim of this project is to secure a distributed SDN controller architecture from DoS attacks and it's variants.
We shall implement the same through 2 phases - simulation and hardware implementation.

In the simulation phase, we shall be using Mininet as our network emulator platform.
We shall be using Ryu as our controller.

In the hardware implementation phase, we shall be using Zodiac FX Switches, Ryu controller.

The folders present in the repository (for now) are as follows: 
1) Ryu - contains all Ryu code, curl command files
2) Mininet - contains custom topologies programmed in Python

You can subscribe to http://aristasdn.blogspot.com to get to know more about the project.

The topology we are working on currently is uploaded.
